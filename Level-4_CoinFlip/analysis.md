# Vulnerability Analysis for Coin Flip Level

## Description

The `CoinFlip` contract contains a vulnerability due to its reliance on pseudo-random number generation based on the previous block's hash and a constant `FACTOR`. This approach is inherently insecure, as the previous block hash is publicly accessible, allowing an attacker to accurately predict the outcome of the coin flip. By replicating the contract’s logic, an attacker can anticipate whether the result will be `true` or `false` before calling the contract’s `flip()` function.

## Exploitation Steps

1. **Retrieve Block Data**:
   - The attacker can retrieve the block hash of the previous block by using `blockhash(block.number - 1)`, enabling them to access the same data the contract uses for randomness.
2. **Calculate Coin Flip Outcome**:
   - Using the formula `uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1)) / FACTOR`, the attacker can compute the outcome of the coin flip. If the result is `1`, it evaluates as `true`; if `0`, it evaluates as `false`.
3. **Execute Exploit via `flip()`**:
   - With the correct outcome prediction, the attacker calls the `flip()` function on the `CoinFlip` contract, passing in the computed result. This guarantees a successful guess, enabling the attacker to manipulate the game consistently.

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Use a Secure Source of Randomness**:
   - To mitigate this vulnerability, it is advisable to implement a secure, off-chain randomness source, such as [Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/). Chainlink VRF generates provably random values that cannot be predicted or tampered with by on-chain actors, making it ideal for applications requiring fairness.
2. **Avoid Predictable Randomness Sources**:
   - Avoid using on-chain values such as block hashes, block timestamps, or other publicly accessible data as randomness sources. These values are often predictable or manipulable, especially in low-difficulty blockchains, and can lead to exploitability.

## Key Takeaways

- **Predictable Randomness**:
   - Utilizing on-chain randomness sources such as block hashes introduces predictability, which is a significant security vulnerability. For applications involving financial stakes or user fairness, secure randomness is essential.
- **Importance of Verifiable Randomness**:
   - When smart contracts rely on randomness, incorporating a trusted and verifiable randomness mechanism, like Chainlink VRF, is critical to ensure fairness and security in decentralized applications (dApps).

## Deployment Instructions

For production environments, ensure that randomness is handled securely by incorporating Chainlink VRF or another reliable external randomness provider. Test thoroughly to confirm that the chosen randomness solution integrates seamlessly and secures the contract against predictive attacks.
